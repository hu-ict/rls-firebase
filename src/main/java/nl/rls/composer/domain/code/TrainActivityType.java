	 * Indicates certain treatments or operations required for a train. If national
	 * codes are used, the first 2 position will be the ISO country code, followed
	 * by 00-99. 0001 Commercial stop RU Board/disembark passenger train,
	 * load/unload freight train 0002 Operational stop IM Stops needed by the IM
	 * (e.g. overpassing by another train) 0003 Service stop RU/IM Stops which are
	 * used for non-commercial activities (e.g. boarding of staff) 0004 System stop
	 * RU/IM allowing the RU to change a system (e.g. signalling system, safety
	 * system) 0005 Reversing stop RU/IM stop to enable train unit to run in the
	 * opposite direction (without change of engine) 0006 Stops for reversing move
	 * or driver change ends RU stop to enable train unit to run in the opposite
	 * direction (with using another engine at the other end of the train and change
	 * of driver) 0007 Stops for locomotive to run round train RU stop to enable
	 * train unit to run in the opposite direction (with using the same engine at
	 * the other end of the train) 0008 Technical check/inspection coaches/wagons

	 * (if offered by the IM or a third party) 0022 Terminal service (terminal in

	 * 0024 Loco driver break RU legal issue, e.g. to respect working law 0025 Crew
	 * change RU different to loco driver change as for the change of the crew a

	 * stop reason (miscellaneous) RU/IM 0028 Boarding only RU 0029 Disembarking
	 * only RU 0030 Stop on request RU 0031 Departure equals to arrival time RU If
	 * in some stations only arrival times are published, this activity code may
	 * used to indicate that the train cannot continue before the published arrival
	 * time in case of an early arrival. 0032 Departure after disembarking RU mainly
	 * used at the end of train run, train may continue as soon as all passengers
	 * have disembarked 0033 No waiting for connection RU 0034 Watering RU Indicates
	 * the IM that a track with water access will be needed. 0035 Heating Indicates

	 * Train running with another train RU Where trains have been attached at a
	 * previous location on the schedule 0044 Next working service RU Association
	 * where there is a need to define a relationship between a train and its next
	 * service. The same vehicle is used for the next train service. Also called
	 * "train-set turnover" 0045 Previous working service RU Association where there
	 * is a need to define a relationship between a train and its previous service.
	 * The same vehicle is reused from the previous train service. 0046 Connecting
