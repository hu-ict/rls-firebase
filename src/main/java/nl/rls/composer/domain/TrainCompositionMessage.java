 *         Train Composition message This message must be sent from the
 *         RU to the next RU, defining the composition of the train. This
 *         message must also be sent from the RU to the IM(s) when requested by
 *         the Conventional Rail TSI Operation and Traffic Management or by the
 *         contract between IM and RU. Whenever there is a change in the
 *         composition during the journey of a train, the RU responsible has to
 *         update this message to all parties involved. The information, which
 *         must be transmitted and be accessible, is: — train number and path
 *         number to identify the path, — path departure point and date and time
 *         for which the path was requested, — path destination point and date
 *         and time at which the proposed train is due to arrive at its
 *         destination, — loco(s) identification and position of loco(s) in the
 *         train, — train length, train weight, maximum speed of the train, —
 *         train composition with the sequence of vehicle IDs, — command and
 *         control system including type of radio equipment, — information
 *         concerning exceptional gauging, — UN/RID numbers of dangerous goods,
 *         — indication if livestock and people (other than the train crew) will
 *         be carried, — braking system to be used, — wagon data. After the
 *         receipt of the train composition the IM may verify the entries
 *         against the contracted path, if the contract between IM and RU
 *         explicitly allows this. In that case the IM must have easy access to
 *         the information about possible restrictions in the relevant
 *         infrastructure, to the technical wagon data (Chapter 4.2.11.3: The
 *         Rolling Stock Reference Databases), to the dangerous goods reference
 *         file and to the current, updated information status on the wagons
 *         (Chapter 4.2.12.2: Other databases , Wagon and Intermodal Unit
 *         Operational Database). This refers to all wagons on the train. In
 *         that case also, the IM, who manages his train paths and keeps up the
 *         actual status of the path information, must add the train details of
 *         the train composition to the path and train data as mentioned in
 *         Chapter 4.2.2.1 (Path request, Preliminary remarks).
